# Code-Mines
A collection of classical problems in programming and their solution.

I want to set a target for me, which although looks farfetched right now, I know would help a lot with my problem of procrastination. 
  
So my target is to write some meaningful code daily. Take at least half an 
hour of my schedule and work on this.

Best of Luck to myself!!
